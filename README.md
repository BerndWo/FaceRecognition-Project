# FaceRecognition-Project :+1:
The goal of this project is to set up a system that can recognize and differentiate between two faces using a Machine Learning algorithm in Python 3.6.

---

## The necessary steps in this project are:

### 1. Set up environment for working collaboratively
- prepare Python programming environment on involved PCs using the Atom editor
  - the required Python packages include: \
      numpy\
      pandas\
      scikit-learn?????????\
      Imglib?????????\
      OpenCV \
      Tensorflow \
      Tensorflow Object Detection API 
- prepare GitHub repository for collaboratively working on the code
- download GitHub Desktop and link the GitHub accounts to Atom in order to be able to edit code there



### 2. Prepare necessary training data for Machine Learning algorithm
- take 100-500 images of each face under different lighting conditions and with different camera angles
- mark the portion of the images that contain the faces using Imglib?????????



### 3. Prepare the training environment
- set up cloud computing environment using **FloyHub** to have access to faster computing power



### 4. Train the Neural Network with the prepared training data
- feed the training data into the **Neural Network** and run it on FloydHub
- save the trained model for deployment later



### 5. Prepare the final hardware system for model deployment
- set up a Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Raspbian as operating system and attach a Raspberry Pi Camera V2.1.
- install the necessary Python packages on the Raspberry Pi (RP)
- load the trained model onto the RP
- run the deployment script
- have fun making faces and seeing if the algorithm can still identify us
